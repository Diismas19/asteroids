# Asteroids

This is one of my guided projects made with [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) guidence.

To use it, you must have pygame package installed.

For now, the game only features the asteroids destruction, I will improve it with better movimentation, scores and lifes.

Use the arrow keys to move and space bar to shot.
